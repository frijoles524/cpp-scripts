# descriptions for each project

1. ctof - This is a simple program that can convert degrees in C to degrees in F and vice versa. I learned how to make and use shared libraries.
2. math - Converts radius to area. I learned how to use cmath.
3. tests.py - Application testing framework in python that works well enough to use for pull requests / commits on github. Not perfect but it works.
